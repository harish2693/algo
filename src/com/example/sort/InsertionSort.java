/**
 * Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm which iterates through the list by consuming one input element at a time
 * and builds the final sorted array. It is very simple and more effective on smaller data sets.
 * It is stable and in-place sorting technique.
 * <p>
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that allows for efficient, in-place sorting of the array, one element at a time.
 * By in-place sorting, we mean that the original array is modified and no temporary structures are needed.
 * <p>
 * Best Case: The best case is when input is an array that is already sorted.
 * In this case insertion sort has a linear running time (i.e., Î˜(n)).
 * <p>
 * Worst Case: The simplest worst case input is an array sorted in reverse order O(n2).

 *
 * 1) The first step is to create a method that takes in input the array to be sorted.
 *
 * 2) The second step is to create an outer for loop which will iterate over each element of the array.
 *
 * 3) The third step is to create a separate iterator, j which will check for the ascending order of elements in the list.
 *
 * 4) The fourth step is the inner while loop:
 *
 *    a) The while loop must satisfy two conditions: the value of j must be greater than 0, and the value at index j-1,
 *    must be greater than the value at index j.
 *    b) If this condition holds true then, the key is set to the value at index j.
 *    c) Then the values at j and j-1 are swapped.
 *    d) The value of j is reduced by 1 and the loop continues till one of the conditions breaks.
 *
 * 5)This continues for every iteration of the outer for loop till that also breaks.
